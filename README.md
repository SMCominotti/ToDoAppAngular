# ToDoAppAngular/ToDo_App

In the first time, you need had Node installed. In my case, I have the version 18.16.1
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) with `npm i -g @angular/cli`, In this moment, the version is 16.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --configuration=production` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
