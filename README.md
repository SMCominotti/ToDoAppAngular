# ToDoAppAngular

The project is situation in the folder `ToDo_App`


In the first time, you need had Node installed. In my case, I have the version 18.16.1


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) with `npm i -g @angular/cli`, In this moment, the version is 16.2.1.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


If you run `ng serve -o`, `http://localhost:4200/` is automatically open.


## Generate a component with Angular CLI

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build --configuration=production` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


In this project, la ruta es `\dist\to-do-app`, don't forguet first put `ToDo_App`.
